## Goal: 
  We are interested in YouTube channel categories that obtain the most number of subscribers. In this report, we are going to use Python to explore the relationship between subscriber count and YouTube channel category.

## Motivation: 
  Our analysis could be useful for people that are interested in starting a new YouTube channel to garner the most amount of subscribers. By finding which YouTube channel category has the most amount of subscribers on average, a user can choose to aim their content in that direction.

## Research Question: 
  Is there a relationship between the Category of YouTube channels and the number of Subscribers that the YouTube channel has?
